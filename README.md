# BKtree-using-Damerau-Levenshtein-distance

In this project we deal with the implementation of a BK-Tree using the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between two words.
The code have to be run using a Python2 kernel and executed in Jupyter Notebook to test each function individually (or as a script, but make sure the path to the dictionnary is correct).
The "Dict.txt" file is the words dictionnary that has been used in testing.
"BktreeDamerauLevenshtein.py" contains the code for the implementation of the BK-Tree giving the possibility to add, remove or search for words in the tree and also saving and restoring it.
